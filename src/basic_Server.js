Then we put type Query into `typeQuery.js` file

- We also define typeMutation into its own file

Combine above into `_schema.js`

/*
Data above is a fake data source. We will replace it with some 
database or rest api calls. There are few ways to do it.
1.Monolithic GraphQL Server: 
  We configure data from this server directly like Postgres, SQL or MongoDB.
  We will write functions to get data, manuplate, authenticate etc.

2.MicroService GraphQl Server: 
  We already have AWS Lambda, Kubernetes or other microservice httpEndpoints
  for each data like login, signup, books data, users data.
  We will use axios to call each endpoint to get Data. We can handle authentication
  in each microservice or handle in this server.
  This approach gives us, seperation of concern if signup microservice breaks, rest
  microservices are working and our graphQL Server is also up and running. This server
  will acts only a combinator for micro-services.
